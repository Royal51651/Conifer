There’s a reason why the amendment protecting freedom of speech is the very first amendment to the U.S. Constitution: it’s because freedom of speech should be an inalienable and intangible right for everyone, everywhere. In the modern age, cases of digital censorship are becoming increasingly prevalent, with massive tech corporations censoring users based on their own political beliefs. Conifer seeks to address this.
<h1>But, how?</h1>
Instead of using one centralized server, Conifer is compltely self-hosted. This means that users are capabale of completely configuring every aspect of the content they consume through Conifer. Instead of some proprietary algorithm kept under lock and key, Conifer takes a unique approach. All posts made to a specific server are put under a central message stream. From there, the user is compltely free to choose the content they want to see.
<h1>How do I set up a server?</h1>
Normally, setting up a backend server of this nature would be a tedious process. However, Conifer provides a simple <a href="https://github.com/Royal51651/Conifer-Server-Util">setup script</a> that makes it dead simple to get up and running. This is all possible largely in thanks to the <a href="https://pocketbase.io/">Pocketbase project</a>, allowing servers to be run on virtually any computer with as little hassle as possible.
